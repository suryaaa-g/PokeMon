# Pokemon Card using API's
Practice using API's using modern JavaScript.

I used the PokeApi https://pokeapi.co/ to make a card for Raichu which has its weight and height. Over winter break I've immersed myself with Web development and just got to the point of using API's. I made this project so I can get a good understanding of using modern javascript and ajax.
